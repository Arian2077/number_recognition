# number_recognition
Hello, nice to see you here :)
This program can recognize the number drawn by yourself , by the way I added some new features like changing the color of brush and doing all four main operations which made me to put second canvas in it
It still has issues that I will fix in the future
And by the way, I use this program with 2160*3840 resolution and it works almost fine, the result may be different in other resolutions.
dont forget to download digits.png and put it in your " F:/ " drive
